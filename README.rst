|Build Status| |Coverage|

A library for finding atom, rss, rdf, and xml feeds from web pages. Produced at the `mediacloud <https://mediacloud.org>`_ project. An incremental improvement over `feedfinder2 <https://github.com/dfm/feedfinder2>`_, which was itself based on `feedfinder <http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/feedfinder/>`_, written by Mark Pilgrim, and maintained by Aaron Swartz until his untimely death. 

Quickstart
==========
By default, the library uses :code:`requests` to grab html and inspect it and find the most
likely feed url:

.. code-block:: python

    from feed_seeker import find_feed_url

    >>> find_feed_url('https://github.com/mitmedialab/feed_seeker') 
    'https://github.com/mitmedialab/feed_seeker/commits/master.atom'


To do a more thorough search, use :code:`generate_feed_urls`, which returns more likely candidates first.

.. code-block:: python

    from feed_seeker import generate_feed_urls
    
    >>> for url in generate_feed_urls('https://xkcd.com'):
    ...     print(url)
    ... 
    https://xkcd.com/atom.xml
    https://xkcd.com/rss.xml


For the most thorough search, add a :code:`spider` argument to do depth-first spidering of urls on the same hostname. Note the below call takes nearly four minutes, compared to 0.5 seconds for :code:`find_feed_url`.


.. code-block:: python

    >>> for url in generate_feed_urls('https://github.com/mitmedialab/feed_seeker', spider=1):
    ...     print(url)
    ...

Installation
------------

The library is not yet available on PyPI, so installation is via github only for now:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/mitmedialab/feed_seeker
                                                  


Differences with :code:`feedfinder2`
====================================
The biggest difference is that all functions are implemented as generators, and are evaluated lazily. Candidate feed links are actually accessed and inspected to determine whether or not they are a feed, which can be quite time consuming. We expose a function to find the most likely feed link, and another to lazily generate links in rough order from most prominent to least.

There are also a few more heuristics based on our experience at `mediacloud <https://mediacloud.org>`_.
